# Install whois on your Kali

# Add to your bash script a sixth option that calls a function to:

function recon_function() {
    # Take a user input string. Presumably the string is a domain name such as Google.com.
    
    # Run whois against a user input string.
    
    # Run dig against the user input string.
    
    # Run host against the user input string.
    
    # Run nslookup against the user input string.
    
} 

recon_function > "output.txt"


# Output the results to a single .txt file and open it with your favorite text editor.

# For this challenge you must use at least one variable and one function.
